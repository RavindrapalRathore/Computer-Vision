Creating a partially annotated image using fully annotated and a reference image

Problem Statement
The code addresses the problem of enhancing and combining two images. Specifically, it takes an original image and a fully annotated image, and based on the "Rate of Foreground (ROF)" in the fully annotated image, it replaces a portion of the original image with the corresponding part of the fully annotated image. The code can be used to overlay annotations on an image while maintaining the content of the original image.
